# üéØ Model Approval System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The new approval workflow allows you to review 3D models before they appear in the gallery. Models are first uploaded to the `/public/models/` folder, then you review and approve them in the dashboard before they become visible to users.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Model ‚Üí 2. Dashboard Review ‚Üí 3. Approve ‚Üí 4. Gallery

```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Add Your 3D Model

1. Place your `.glb` or `.gltf` file in:
   ```
   /public/models/your-model-name.glb
   ```

2. Register it in `/src/utils/modelMatcher.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const MODEL_REGISTRY: ModelDefinition[] = [
     // Existing approved models...

     // Your new model (not approved yet)
     {
       fileName: 'blue-whale.glb',
       creatureName: 'Blue Whale',
       category: 'mammals',
       modelPath: '/models/blue-whale.glb',
       approved: false  // ‚è≥ Pending approval
     },
   ];
   ```

### Step 2: Review in Dashboard

1. Open the dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   ```

2. Login (if required)

3. Click the **"‚úÖ Pending Approvals"** tab
   - You'll see a notification badge showing the number of pending models

4. Your model appears as a card with:
   - 3D preview (rotating)
   - Model name and filename
   - Category dropdown selector
   - "Approve & Add to Gallery" button

### Step 3: Approve the Model

1. **Review the 3D preview** - Verify the model looks correct

2. **Select the category** - Choose which gallery page it should appear on:
   - üêü Fish
   - üêã Marine Mammals
   - ü¶Ä Shellfish
   - üêô Mollusks
   - ü™º Jellyfish
   - üê¢ Sea Reptiles
   - üåä Baltic Species

3. **Click "Approve & Add to Gallery"**
   - Model is approved and saved in localStorage
   - Disappears from pending list
   - Immediately appears in the selected gallery category!

### Step 4: View in Gallery

1. Go to the gallery:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/gallery
   ```

2. Navigate to the category you selected

3. Your model now appears with a green **3D** badge

4. Click it to view in AR!

## Current Model Status

### ‚úÖ Already Approved (in code):

1. **Tuna Fish** (`tuna fish-fish.glb`)
   - Shows in: Fish gallery
   - Attached to: existing "Tuna" creature
   - Status: `approved: true` in code

2. **Zebrasoma Xanthurum** (`Zebrasoma Xanthurum-fish.glb`)
   - Shows in: Fish gallery
   - Attached to: existing "Zebrasoma" creature
   - Status: `approved: true` in code

### ‚è≥ Pending Approval (needs review):

3. **Koi Fish** (`Koi fish - fish.gltf`)
   - Waiting in: Dashboard ‚Üí Pending Approvals tab
   - Will create: NEW creature "Koi Fish"
   - Status: `approved: false` in code

---

## How Approval Status Works

### Static Approval (in code):
```typescript
{
  fileName: 'tuna fish-fish.glb',
  creatureId: 'tuna',
  category: 'fish',
  modelPath: '/models/tuna fish-fish.glb',
  approved: true  // ‚úÖ Always approved
}
```

### Dynamic Approval (via dashboard):
```typescript
{
  fileName: 'Koi fish - fish.gltf',
  creatureName: 'Koi Fish',
  category: 'fish',
  modelPath: '/models/Koi fish - fish.gltf',
  approved: false  // ‚è≥ Pending - shows in dashboard
}
```

When you approve in the dashboard:
- Approval status saved in **localStorage** (`model_approvals`)
- Selected category saved in **localStorage** (`model_categories`)
- System checks both code (`approved: true`) AND localStorage
- Once approved, model appears in gallery automatically

---

## Adding New Models (Quick Reference)

### Option A: Pre-Approved (Skip Dashboard)

For models you trust immediately:

```typescript
{
  fileName: 'shark-3d.glb',
  creatureId: 'shark',
  category: 'fish',
  modelPath: '/models/shark-3d.glb',
  approved: true  // ‚úÖ Goes straight to gallery
}
```

### Option B: Pending Approval (Review First)

For models you want to review:

```typescript
{
  fileName: 'new-creature.glb',
  creatureName: 'New Creature',
  category: 'fish',
  modelPath: '/models/new-creature.glb',
  approved: false  // ‚è≥ Shows in dashboard first
}
```

## Example Workflow

### Adding a Dolphin Model:

1. **Upload file:**
   ```bash
   # Copy to:
   /public/models/dolphin-animated.glb
   ```

2. **Register in code:**
   ```typescript
   {
     fileName: 'dolphin-animated.glb',
     creatureId: 'dolphin',  // Attach to existing dolphin
     category: 'mammals',
     modelPath: '/models/dolphin-animated.glb',
     approved: false  // Needs approval
   }
   ```

3. **Go to dashboard:**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - Click "Pending Approvals" tab
   - See "Dolphin" card with 3D preview

4. **Review and approve:**
   - Watch 3D preview rotate
   - Verify it looks good
   - Select "Marine Mammals" category
   - Click "Approve & Add to Gallery"

5. **View in gallery:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/gallery`

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Showing in Dashboard?

**Check:**
1. File exists in `/public/models/`
2. Registered in `MODEL_REGISTRY` array
3. `approved: false` (if true, it's already in gallery)
4. Hard refresh dashboard (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Model Not Appearing in Gallery After Approval?

**Solution:**
1. Refresh gallery page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify localStorage has the approval:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.getItem('model_approvals')
   ```

### Want to Un-Approve a Model?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const approvals = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('model_approvals') || '{}');
delete approvals['filename.glb'];
localStorage.setItem('model_approvals', JSON.stringify(approvals));
// Then refresh the page
```
