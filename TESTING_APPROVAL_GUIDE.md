## 📋 What You Can Test & Review

### 1. **File Information** 📋

**What You See:**
- **Format**: GLB (Binary) or GLTF (JSON)
- **File Size**: Actual size in MB or KB
- **File Path**: Location in your project

**Why It Matters:**
- GLB files are better (single file, everything embedded)
- Large files (>10MB) may load slowly
- Verify correct path before approving

---

### 2. **Model Statistics** 📊

**What You See:**
- **Vertices**: Number of points in the model
- **Triangles**: Number of polygons (affects performance)
- **Materials**: Number of materials/textures
- **Animations**: How many animations are embedded
- **Textures**: Whether textures are included

**Why It Matters:**
- **Triangles < 100,000** = Good performance ✅
- **Triangles > 100,000** = May lag on mobile ⚠️
- **Animations > 0** = Model will animate in AR 🎬
- **No Textures** = Model may look plain ⚠️

---

### 3. **Quality Checks** ✓

**Automatic Validation:**
- ✅ File exists
- ✅ Format valid
- ✅ Poly count check (optimal/high warning)
- ✅ Animation detection

**Status Indicators:**
- **✓ Pass** = Everything good
- **⚠ High** = Works but may affect performance
- **- None** = Feature not available

---

### 4. **Interactive 3D Preview** 🔄

**Controls:**
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate model
