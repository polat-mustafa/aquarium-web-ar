# 3D Models Folder

This folder contains 3D models for AR creatures in the Aquarium app.

## How to Add 3D Models

1. **File Format**: Upload your 3D models in `.glb` or `.gltf` format
2. **Naming Convention**: Name your file matching the creature ID from the gallery
   - Example: `shark.glb`, `angelfish.glb`, `dolphin.glb`
3. **File Location**: Place files directly in `/public/models/` folder

## Supported Creature IDs

The following creature IDs are available in the gallery:

### Fish
- `shark` - Great White Shark
- `angelfish` - Angelfish
- `tuna` - Bluefin Tuna

### Marine Mammals
- `whale` - Humpback Whale
- `dolphin` - Bottlenose Dolphin
- `seal` - Harbor Seal

### Shellfish
- `crab` - Red Crab
- `lobster` - European Lobster
- `shrimp` - Giant Shrimp

### Mollusks
- `octopus` - Giant Pacific Octopus
- `squid` - Giant Squid

### Jellyfish
- `jellyfish` - Moon Jellyfish
- `medusa` - Blue Blubber

### Sea Reptiles
- `turtle` - Green Sea Turtle
- `sea-snake` - Sea Snake

### Baltic Species
- `herring` - Baltic Herring
- `cod` - Baltic Cod
- `flounder` - European Flounder
- `baltic-seal` - Baltic Grey Seal

## Automatic Integration

Once you upload a 3D model:
1. The gallery will automatically detect it
2. A green "3D" badge will appear on the creature card
3. Clicking the creature will load your 3D model in AR
4. If no model exists, a üì¶ placeholder icon will be shown

## Model Requirements

- **Format**: GLB (recommended) or GLTF
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB for optimal mobile performance
- **Optimization**: Use compressed textures and simplified geometry
- **Scale**: Models will be auto-scaled to fit AR viewport
- **Orientation**: Y-up is recommended

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: GLTF vs GLB

**Always prefer GLB format!**

- **GLB** = Single binary file (‚úÖ Recommended)
  - Contains everything: geometry, textures, materials
  - Just works - drag and drop

- **GLTF** = Multiple files (‚ö†Ô∏è Requires .bin file)
  - Needs: `.gltf` (JSON) + `.bin` (binary data) + texture files
  - If `.bin` file is missing, the model **will not load**
  - You'll see "3D Preview Unavailable" error

### Current Issue: Koi Fish Model

The current `Koi fish - fish.gltf` file is **broken** because it's missing `scene.bin`.

**How to fix:**
1. Download a complete Koi fish model in GLB format from:
   - [Animated Koi Fish (Sketchfab)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/animated-low-poly-koi-fish-65fc24a235f64bf3b4951c0111d0e4d4)
   - Or search Sketchfab for "koi fish" and filter by "Downloadable"

2. Save as: `public/models/Koi fish - fish.glb`

3. Delete the old GLTF file:
   ```bash
   rm "public/models/Koi fish - fish.gltf"
   ```

4. Update `src/utils/modelMatcher.ts`:
   - Change `fileName: 'Koi fish - fish.gltf'` to `'Koi fish - fish.glb'`
   - Change `approved: false` to `approved: true`

5. Refresh the dashboard - Koi fish will now work!

## Example Structure

```
/public/models/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shark.glb          ‚úÖ Will show in gallery with 3D badge
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ angelfish.glb      ‚úÖ Will show in gallery with 3D badge
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dolphin.glb        ‚úÖ Will show in gallery with 3D badge
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          (this file)
```

Any creature without a model file will display the default emoji icon with a üì¶ placeholder indicator.
